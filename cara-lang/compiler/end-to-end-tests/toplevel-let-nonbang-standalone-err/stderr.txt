E0011: Unused expression

The expression was not bound to an identifier. Either remove it or bind it:

  x = 123

Note: Since Cara is pure, the content of the expression (if not using a bang
pattern `!`) is guaranteed to not influence the rest of the program in any way
and thus is considered dead code.

main.cara:1:1
━━┓
1 ┃ 123
  ┃ ^
